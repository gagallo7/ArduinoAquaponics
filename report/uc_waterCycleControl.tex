    The fish tank's water should be pumped to the vegetable media each quarter of an hour.

%Main Success Scenario: A typical, unconditional happy path scenario of success.

	\item The Microcontroller executes a run cycle of 25\% in the PWM in a 1 hour period.
	\item The circuit sends this signal to a relay.
    \item The relay activates the water pump at a 15 minutes per hour rate with the adequate voltage.
