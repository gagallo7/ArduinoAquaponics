Design the proof of concept of a system that is capable to automatically control and optimize the water cycle and its quality of an Aquaponics system via microcontroller.

% Macro and Micro
% What was implemented what wasn't.

What is in the scope of this proof of concept:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatized Water Cycling for exchange water between tanks
    \item Water pH Level Automatic Control
\end{itemize}

What is out of scope:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic Fish Feeding
    \item Aquaponics structural design which doesn't regard automation,
        such as: tanks, pipes etc
    \item Root Cloging prevention
\end{itemize}
