\subsection{A Graphical User Interface}

For the sake of making the unit tests to be shown in a written report,
a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been implemented using Processing.
Processing is a simple programing language which is integrated with OpenGL,
Java and Serial communication.
So it is a reliable choice to display and transmit Serial data from/to Arduino within the computer screen.
But,
instead of being a monitoring-only GUI,
the Processing provides built-in functions to make mouse interactions easily,
hence the tests could be made faster.
