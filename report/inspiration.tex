There are some automated aquaponics projects available on the Internet,
but most of them doesn't have a reasonable good documentation.
So it has been needed to grab parts of information among every material found on Internet.
One of the best sources found was from a hackaday's post,
it describes with decent detail how they achieved the construction of their Arduino-powered aquaponics system.

A great amount of the published projects has a commercial goal:
to make an efficient and small-sized system that can afford to produce organic products in a large scale.

On other hand, the Goddek et al. paper
