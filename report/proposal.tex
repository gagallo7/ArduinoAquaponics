\subsection{Prototype Implementation and Project Decisions}
There are a lot of authors that have had experience with Aquaponics automation.
Most of them chooses Arduino or Raspberry Pi as the main microcontroller.

Two great reasons for the Arduino's usage are:
This work's author already has an Arduino UNO,
but not a Raspberry PI.
Besides the main reference of this work,
the Kretzinger's guide \cite{Leatherbury2014},
who has many years of experience with Aquaponics and its automation and he uses the Arduino as microcontroller.

The chosen components have been based in the references.
