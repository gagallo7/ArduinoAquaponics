% V-model
\subsection{Approach}
This work has been implemented with an adaptation of V-model development process
\footnote{Described in detail here: \cite{mathur2010advancements}}.
The original version of this process is known as a variation of the waterfall process,
with several phases that resembles the latter,
but the their displacement is slightly modified,
emphasising on the coding phase.

An appealing feature of the V-model is that every phase,
before the coding one,
has a 1:1 strong relationship with the phases that occurs after the coding,
as seen in figure \ref{fig:v-model},
reinforcing the mapping of the theoretical part of the project with the practical one.
Moreover,
in comparison with Agile models,
there is much more documentation in a project using V-model,
and this feature is crucial for this work.

    \label{fig:v-model}
\end{figure}

The adaptation made in this project was to divide the V-model into iterations separated by the use cases.
That is,
for every use case,
there are the execution of every phase of V-model,
as if the product would have only one use case.

After some research about the flaws of V-model,
a variation of the V-model has been found and it shares the fundamental difference between this work's approach and V-model:
the Dual V-model \cite{clark2009system}.
The shared idea is: divide and conquer V-model, 
by making subsystems that follows V-model,
so,
when these subsystems are finished,
they can be integrated to create the final product.

\end{description}


In order to demonstrate the proof of concept without any physical building,
there is a video with a Graphical User Interface in the section \ref{sec:video},
which the user can simulate how the system responds to the undesired pH values in the tank.
This video is made based on the IP Capture library for Processing \cite{ipcapture_2016},
that makes feasible to render life video from a IP camera,
hence it is possible to watch what happens with the Arduino in real-time when one changes a sensor value.

\subsection{System Design}
\label{sec:design}

The figure \ref{fig:highLevelSystemDesign} shows a high level diagram to demonstrate how the automation can be implemented in the Aquaponics.
Each node has an input and output,
indicated by an incoming and outgoing arrows, respectfully.

The components are from the original Aquaponics system,
which are surveyed by the sensors.
The latter captures dedicated data from the medium,
like temperature or water level and emits an electronic signal to the microcontroller.

The latter is the main responsible for the automation,
it is where the logic is stored,
so the input signal are interpreted by the installed program and another electronic signal is sent to the components,
this signal could be directed or indirect,
the former is when the output current is enough to the target component to work,
otherwise the latter is used via a relay,
that is connected with an external power supply,
and behaves as an signal amplifier.

\end{figure}

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

Figure \ref{sec:architecture} illustrates the low-level design.
Based on the figure \ref{fig:highLevelSystemDesign},
the figure \ref{fig:waterCycleDiagram} depicts a model to automatize the water cycle control from the requirement \ref{req1}.
Now one can see where to connect each terminal and every important component is presented.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{diagrams/architecture_bb}
    \caption{This diagram shows how the microcontroller interacts with the water pump}
    \label{fig:waterCycleDiagram}
\end{figure}

Each wire color has a meaning.
Blue represents the ground voltage,
red is high voltage
and yellow is low voltage.
The submersible water pump is located inside the fish tank and normally is turned off.
When the periodic signal comes from the microcontroller's digital output,
it is amplified by the relay switching,
which in turn makes the power supply to deliver high voltage to the water pump,
the latter works until the relay is switched again by the microcontroller's signal downtime.

\subsection{Project Decisions}
There are a lot of authors \cite{GoddekDelaideMankasinghEtAl2015} \cite{clark2009system} \cite{Leatherbury2014} that have had experience with Aquaponics automation.
Most of them chooses Arduino or Raspberry Pi as the main microcontroller.

Two great reasons for the Arduino's usage are:
This work's author already has an Arduino UNO,
but not a Raspberry PI.
Besides the main reference of this work,
the \cite{Kretzinger2015},
whose author has many years of experience with Aquaponics and its automation and he uses the Arduino as microcontroller.

The chosen components have been based in the references.
