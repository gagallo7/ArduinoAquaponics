\subsection{Background}
An extensive research has been made aiming at some basic Aquaponics knowledge and previous Aquaponics automation projects.
The idea for creating a water cycle has came from \cite{simpleArduinoAquaponics},
where a simple project is proposed and an Arduino only automates this very feature of the system.
But the system design of the former project with 3 tanks and 1 second water cycle will not be applied,
the \cite{Kretzinger2015} uses a simpler approach with only 2 tanks and a periodic water cycle,
with the difference that the period is much longer.

There are some projects that uses multiples microcontrollers,
like \cite{GarethColeman2014},
which uses an Arduino Mega with Raspberry PI.
To make the things simpler,
this project focuses on using only one microcontroller.
