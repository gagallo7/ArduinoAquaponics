% Which were the difficulties?
% Is there any POC?
% What is the contribution of this work?

As the author of this work did not have the enough experience with microelectronics,
because he had been doing the software-biased modality of his degree,
he had some difficulties relating the schematics designs,
how to use relays and other advanced components.

There are three main contributions provenient from this work: 
simple automatization of a relevant system with inexpansive components,
a documented project based on variations of a classic development model and engineering abstractions,
and a simple GUI to detail what happens with each component when the automatization happens.

The latter contribution serves as the high-level demonstration of the POC,
evincing that the use cases are being respected by simulating the sensor's value in real-time.

In the interface's aspect,
due to the communication protocol,
it is feasible to extend this system to respond to the new use cases,
such as automatic fish feeding,
solar illumation simulation,
temperature control and root cloging prevention.
The modification needed in this case is just new commands to treat new sensors inputs and outputs.
