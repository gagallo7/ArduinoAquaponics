\subsection{Motivation}
When someone builds an Aquaponics system,
one needs to manage it everyday,
since there is a plenty of work to do for maintaining the system work,
because it deals with living beings.
So it is a time wasting management,
with lots of repetitive tasks,
which one can be understood as periodic events.

Some of these tasks can be reliably automated,
together with others that involves problems that may occur during the system's growth.
For example, the fish feeding is a periodic event,
but the water's pH control is not a periodic event,
instead it is classified as an adverse event.

Basically this work is trying to decrease human intervention in an Aquaponics system via automatic management of adverse and periodic events,
in order to reduce the time wasted to take care of the system, 
as well as to make the management more reliable.

\subsubsection{Context}

\subsection{Challenges}

\subsubsection{Without automation}
To build an Aquaponics system,
one needs to be precise and cautious when one makes the design of the project,
there are lots of requirements that need to be respected in order to make the Aquaponics work.
The most important requirements are strongly connected with equilibrium,
because we are dealing with a biological system.
For example,
the proportion between the fish tank and the plant's grow bed tank are vital to optimize.
If one gets the wrong proportion,
the system won't work,
both the fish and the plants will die precociously \cite{Leatherbury2014}.

Another problem is to distribute the byproducts of each medium to another one,
the main byproduct of the fish tank is ammonia,
if the concentration of the latter increases,
the fish will die by high toxicity,
hence this ammonia has to be delivered to the bacteria,
who will digest this substance via the nitrogen cycle,
producing nitrate.

As the final product are comestibles,
there is another concern: food toxicity.
One cannot use components made with materials that can cause water contamination,
because the fish and the plant will be contaminated as well.
So there is the need to use non-toxic elements in the system.
Besides there is also a high concern with the water source,
the water cannot be infected with pathogens that causes diseases,
like amoeba.

\subsubsection{With automation}
In order to automate an Aquaponics system,
one must take care with microelectronic components,
they have to be protected from water and humidity.

Second,
there is the need to use relays to add high current-drain devices,
like the submersible water pump,
which is essential to the system.
